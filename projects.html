                    <div class="card-header">Battleships — Teaching History Through Play</div>
                    <p>Reimagined Battleship as a hybrid physical-digital game to teach historical naval battles. Used
                        computer vision and projection mapping to merge digital feedback with physical gameplay.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Built with OpenCV (Python), PyGame, and image processing techniques. I learned how playful
                        design can make education tangible, and how UX testing matters when designing for real-world
                        interaction.</p>

                    <div class="card-header">Sound-Box — Immersive Audio for Tabletop Games</div>
                    <p>Created a physical audio trigger box to enhance atmosphere in tabletop RPGs, mapping player
                        actions to ambient sounds. <br><br></p>
                    <p>Developed with Arduino (C/C++) and custom sound logic. I learned to bridge hardware with
                        experience design — and that audio has emotional power in gameplay.</p>

                    <div class="card-header">Rock Art — VR Cultural Experience</div>
                    <p>Developed a VR experience that lets users simulate prehistoric rock carving through hand-tracked
                        gestures, blending culture and interactivity. <br><br></p>
                    <p>Built in Unity using C#. I learned how spatial tech can turn history into a tactile experience,
                        and how intuitive interaction makes abstract ideas come alive.</p>

                    <div class="card-header">Timbre Transfer</div>
                    <p>Trained neural models to work along an generative autoencoder to learn and generate effects on
                        music tracks based on artists' destinct voices, analyzing sound
                        transformations through user testing. <br><br></p>
                    <p>Built in Python using TensorFlow. I gained ML and signal processing skills, and learned to handle
                        imperfect data with creative resilience.</p>

                    <div class="card-header">Architectural VR — Exploring Sustainable Design</div>
                    <p>Designed a VR walkthrough to help users explore sustainable architecture, gathering design
                        feedback through interactive tours. <br><br></p>
                    <p>Built in Unreal Engine using C++. I learned how to blend clarity and exploration in immersive
                        design, and
                        how environment layout affects understanding.</p>

                    <p>Replaced button-based pointing with thrust-based gestures to create more engaging and physical VR
                        interaction. <br><br></p>
                    <p>Built in Unreal Engine using C++. I learned to map physical motion to user intent — and started
                        thinking more critically about embodiment in design.</p>
